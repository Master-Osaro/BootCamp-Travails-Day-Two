# Bootcamp-day2-corrections
Applied BFA's correction on my repo BootcampDay2.
With help from leke and amah i was able to use tdd for code-lab1, datatypes using jasmine.
Used Readme.md instead of uploading a text file.
Constraint : currently working on the test that returns a function. I will commit immediately when done
